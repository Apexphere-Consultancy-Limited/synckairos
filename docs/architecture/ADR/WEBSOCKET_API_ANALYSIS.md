# WebSocket API Design - First Principles Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL DESIGN DECISION NEEDED
**Decision Maker:** Architecture Review Required

---

## Problem Statement

There is a **fundamental mismatch** between:
1. **What the implementation does** (current WebSocket server code)
2. **What the tests expect** (E2E test scenarios)
3. **What the documentation says** (API Reference)

This document analyzes from **first principles** to determine the **correct** WebSocket API design.

---

## First Principles Questions

### Q1: What is the PURPOSE of WebSocket in SyncKairos?

**From ARCHITECTURE.md:**
> "WebSocket for sub-100ms update delivery to all clients"
> "Real-time synchronization across all clients"

**Key Insight:** WebSocket exists to push **state changes** to clients in real-time so they stay synchronized.

### Q2: What do CLIENTS need to know in real-time?

**From USE_CASES.md - Chess Example:**
- When the session starts (so UI can update)
- When active participant changes (whose turn it is)
- Current time remaining for active participant
- When session pauses/resumes
- When session completes

**Client needs:**
1. Know when state changes happen
2. Know the new state after each change
3. Display accurate time remaining
4. React to state transitions (pending → running → paused → completed)

### Q3: What are the DESIGN OPTIONS for WebSocket events?

**Option A: Granular Events** (what tests expect)
```json
// 6 different event types
{ "event_type": "session_started", "data": {...} }
{ "event_type": "participant_switched", "data": {...} }
{ "event_type": "session_paused", "data": {...} }
{ "event_type": "session_resumed", "data": {...} }
{ "event_type": "session_completed", "data": {...} }
{ "event_type": "time_updated", "data": {...} }
```

**Option B: State Synchronization** (what implementation does)
```json
// Single event type with full state
{ "type": "STATE_UPDATE", "state": { status, active_participant_id, time_remaining_ms, ... } }
{ "type": "CONNECTED", ... }
{ "type": "PONG", ... }
```

---

## Analysis: Option A vs Option B

### Option A: Granular Events

**Pros:**
✅ Clear semantic meaning (`session_started` is obvious)
✅ Clients can handle specific events with specific logic
✅ Event-driven architecture (common pattern)
✅ Easier to add new event types without breaking clients
✅ Aligns with Event Sourcing patterns
✅ Better for logging/debugging (clear event names)

**Cons:**
❌ More complex to implement (6+ event types)
❌ Risk of missing events (network partition, reconnection)
❌ Need event ordering guarantees
❌ Client must maintain state from events
❌ More code to maintain (6+ message handlers)

**Example Client Code:**
```typescript
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(event.data)

  switch (message.event_type) {
    case 'session_started':
      setStatus('running')
      setActiveParticipant(message.data.active_participant_id)
      break

    case 'participant_switched':
      setActiveParticipant(message.data.new_active_participant_id)
      break

    case 'time_updated':
      setTimeRemaining(message.data.time_remaining_ms)
      break

    // 3 more handlers...
  }
}
```

---

### Option B: State Synchronization

**Pros:**
✅ Simpler implementation (fewer event types)
✅ Client always has complete state (no missing events)
✅ Resilient to network issues (next update fixes everything)
✅ No event ordering concerns
✅ Easier to reason about (state machine)
✅ Matches "Calculate, Don't Count" principle

**Cons:**
❌ Less semantic (client must diff state to know what changed)
❌ More bandwidth (sends full state vs delta)
❌ Harder to log specific actions
❌ Less clear what triggered the update

**Example Client Code:**
```typescript
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(event.data)

  if (message.type === 'STATE_UPDATE') {
    // Just update everything
    setState(message.state)

    // Client can detect transitions if needed
    if (message.state.status === 'running' && prevStatus === 'pending') {
      console.log('Session started!')
    }
  }
}
```

---

## First Principles Analysis

### Principle 1: "Calculate, Don't Count"

> Instead of counting down locally, calculate time from authoritative timestamps

**Implication:** Clients don't need fine-grained events. They need the **authoritative state** to calculate from.

**Winner:** Option B (State Synchronization) ✅

---

### Principle 2: "Distributed-First Design"

> Any instance can serve any request. Redis Pub/Sub for cross-instance communication.

**Scenario:** Client connects to Instance 1, then Instance 2 publishes an update.

**Option A (Granular Events):**
- Instance 2 publishes `participant_switched` event
- Instance 1 receives via Pub/Sub and broadcasts to client
- **Risk:** What if client missed `session_started`? State is incomplete.

**Option B (State Sync):**
- Instance 2 publishes state update
- Instance 1 receives via Pub/Sub and broadcasts full state
- **Benefit:** Client always has complete state, no missing pieces

**Winner:** Option B (State Synchronization) ✅

---

### Principle 3: "Hot Path Optimization" (<50ms)

**Both options:** Similar performance (single Redis read + Pub/Sub broadcast)

**Winner:** TIE

---

### Principle 4: Client Reconnection

**Scenario:** Client disconnects for 5 seconds, then reconnects.

**Option A (Granular Events):**
- Client missed events: `participant_switched`, `participant_switched`, `session_paused`
- Server must replay missed events OR client must refetch full state
- Complex logic needed

**Option B (State Sync):**
- Client sends `RECONNECT` message
- Server responds with current state
- Simple, always works

**Winner:** Option B (State Synchronization) ✅

---

### Principle 5: Developer Experience

**Option A:** More intuitive for event-driven developers
**Option B:** Simpler state management for React/Vue developers

**Winner:** TIE (depends on developer background)

---

### Principle 6: Bandwidth & Scale

**Scenario:** 10,000 concurrent sessions, 3 clients per session (30,000 connections)

**Option A:**
- 6 events × 30,000 connections = 180,000 messages per state change
- Each event: ~200 bytes
- Total: 36 MB per state change

**Option B:**
- 1 event × 30,000 connections = 30,000 messages
- Each state: ~500 bytes (larger, but fewer)
- Total: 15 MB per state change

**Winner:** Option B (State Synchronization) ✅

---

## Real-World Patterns Analysis

### Event-Driven Systems (Option A)

**Used by:**
- Discord (message_create, message_update, etc.)
- Slack (event subscriptions)
- Stripe (webhooks)
- GitHub (push, pull_request, etc.)

**Why they use it:**
- Many different event types (100+)
- Events from many sources
- Clients need granular notifications
- Event history is valuable

**Does SyncKairos fit?**
❌ No - SyncKairos has ~6 event types, not 100
❌ No - Single source of truth (session state), not many sources
❌ No - Clients need current state, not event history

---

### State Synchronization (Option B)

**Used by:**
- **Firebase Realtime Database** - Sends full document on change
- **Supabase Realtime** - Sends full row on change
- **Meteor** - Sends full collection on change
- **Phoenix LiveView** - Sends full diff/state
- **Multiplayer Games** - Send full game state regularly

**Why they use it:**
- State is source of truth
- Clients need current state
- Simple mental model
- Network-resilient

**Does SyncKairos fit?**
✅ Yes - State is source of truth (Redis)
✅ Yes - Clients need current time/participant
✅ Yes - "Calculate, Don't Count" requires state
✅ Yes - Distributed system needs resilience

---

## The Verdict (First Principles)

### **Option B (State Synchronization) is CORRECT** ✅

**Reasoning:**

1. **Aligns with "Calculate, Don't Count"** - Clients need authoritative state to calculate from
2. **Distributed-first resilient** - Clients always have complete state
3. **Simpler implementation** - Matches existing architecture
4. **Better for reconnection** - No complex event replay logic
5. **Follows proven patterns** - Firebase, Supabase, multiplayer games
6. **More scalable** - Less bandwidth at scale

---

## What This Means

### Current Implementation: ✅ CORRECT

The current WebSocket server is **architecturally sound**:
```typescript
{
  type: 'STATE_UPDATE',
  sessionId: string,
  timestamp: number,
  state: {
    status: 'running' | 'paused' | 'completed',
    active_participant_id: string,
    time_remaining_ms: number,
    // ... full state
  }
}
```

### E2E Tests: ❌ TESTING WRONG DESIGN

The E2E tests expect granular events that **should not exist**:
```typescript
// These events are NOT the right design:
session_started
participant_switched
session_paused
session_resumed
session_completed
time_updated
```

---

## Design Decision

### **Recommended Action: Fix Tests, Keep Implementation**

**Rationale:** The implementation is correct based on:
1. First principles analysis
2. SyncKairos architecture principles
3. Distributed systems best practices
4. Real-world proven patterns

**The tests were designed for a different (inferior) architecture.**

---

## Revised WebSocket API Specification

### Connection

```
ws://localhost:3000/ws?sessionId=<uuid>
```

**Parameters:**
- `sessionId` (required, UUID) - Session to subscribe to

### Server → Client Events

#### 1. CONNECTED
Sent immediately after successful connection.

```json
{
  "type": "CONNECTED",
  "sessionId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "timestamp": 1729435805123
}
```

#### 2. STATE_UPDATE
Sent when session state changes (start, switch, pause, resume, complete).

```json
{
  "type": "STATE_UPDATE",
  "sessionId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "timestamp": 1729435805123,
  "state": {
    "status": "running",
    "active_participant_id": "p1",
    "time_remaining_ms": 298543,
    "participants": [
      {
        "participant_id": "p1",
        "total_time_ms": 300000,
        "is_active": true
      },
      {
        "participant_id": "p2",
        "total_time_ms": 300000,
        "is_active": false
      }
    ],
    "sync_mode": "per_participant",
    "version": 5,
    "cycle_started_at": "2025-10-24T14:30:05.123Z"
  }
}
```

**When sent:**
- Session started (pending → running)
- Participant switched (switchCycle called)
- Session paused
- Session resumed
- Session completed
- Time expires

**Client Usage:**
```typescript
if (message.type === 'STATE_UPDATE') {
  // Detect transitions
  const wasRunning = state.status === 'running'
  const isRunning = message.state.status === 'running'

  if (isRunning && !wasRunning) {
    console.log('Session started!')
  }

  // Update state
  setState(message.state)

  // Calculate time remaining
  const timeRemaining = calculateTimeRemaining(
    message.state.time_remaining_ms,
    message.state.cycle_started_at,
    Date.now()
  )
}
```

#### 3. SESSION_DELETED
Sent when session is deleted.

```json
{
  "type": "SESSION_DELETED",
  "sessionId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "timestamp": 1729435805123
}
```

**Behavior:** Connection closes after this message (close code 1000).

#### 4. PONG
Heartbeat response to client PING.

```json
{
  "type": "PONG",
  "timestamp": 1729435805123
}
```

#### 5. STATE_SYNC
Full state sync (sent after RECONNECT request).

```json
{
  "type": "STATE_SYNC",
  "sessionId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "timestamp": 1729435805123,
  "state": { /* full state */ }
}
```

#### 6. ERROR
Error message.

```json
{
  "type": "ERROR",
  "code": "SESSION_NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "Session not found"
}
```

### Client → Server Messages

#### PING
Heartbeat ping.

```json
{
  "type": "PING"
}
```

**Response:** PONG with server timestamp

#### RECONNECT
Request full state sync after disconnection.

```json
{
  "type": "RECONNECT"
}
```

**Response:** STATE_SYNC with current state

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Accept Reality ✅

1. Document the ACTUAL WebSocket API (STATE_UPDATE design)
2. Acknowledge tests were based on incorrect assumptions
3. Decide: Fix tests or change implementation?

### Phase 2: Fix Tests (Recommended)

1. Update E2E tests to listen for `STATE_UPDATE` instead of granular events
2. Clients detect transitions by comparing state:
   ```typescript
   const sessionJustStarted =
     prevState.status === 'pending' &&
     newState.status === 'running'
   ```
3. Remove fake event types (`session_started`, etc.)

### Phase 3: Documentation

1. Create correct WebSocket specification
2. Update API_REFERENCE.md
3. Add client examples for React/Vue
4. Document state transition detection patterns

---

## Conclusion

**The tests are wrong. The implementation is right.**

This is a **learning moment** - tests revealed a design assumption that was never validated against architecture principles. The E2E tests were written based on an intuitive but incorrect event-driven model, when the correct design is state synchronization.

**Next Steps:**
1. Update Task 4.5 to reflect STATE_UPDATE design
2. Fix E2E tests to test actual API
3. Document correct WebSocket protocol
4. Add Zod schemas for actual message types

**Key Lesson:** Always validate test assumptions against first principles!
