- **Performance Improvement:** Alerting **5000x faster** (70s → 14ms), Retry **92% faster** (150s → 12s)
- **Test Organization:** ✅ Proper categorization (unit/integration/performance)
- **Issues Resolved:** 4 (U1: 30 tests, U2: 26/58 tests, U3: 5 tests, U5: complete reclassification)
- **Remaining Work:**
  - Issue #U4: Fix Redis eviction policy (MEDIUM)
  - Issue #U6: Mock 2 DatabaseConfig tests (LOW)

---

## Issue Categories

- 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Blocks CI/CD deployment (must fix immediately)
- 🟡 **MEDIUM** - May cause test failures or coverage gaps (should fix)
- 🟢 **LOW** - Enhancement or technical debt (optional)

## Recent Progress

### Completed (2025-10-25 to 2025-10-26)
1. ✅ Fixed database test UUIDs (Issue #U1) - All 30 database tests passing
2. ✅ Fixed validation test assertions (Issue #U3) - 5 validation tests passing
3. ✅ Converted alerting tests to true unit tests (Issue #U5) - 13 tests in 14ms (5000x faster)
4. ✅ Optimized retry integration tests (Issue #U5) - 150s → 12s (92% faster via config + isolation + parallelism)
5. ✅ Updated tester skill with optimization principles
6. ✅ **Fixed Issue #U2 (partial)** - 26 API integration tests fixed (schema validation errors)
   - Fixed 155 invalid participant IDs across 5 test files
   - Tests passing: 16 → 42 (163% increase)
   - Root cause: Invalid UUIDs and time values in test data
7. ✅ **Split DBWriteQueue.test.ts** (Issue #U5) - Created api.test.ts (6 unit, 90ms) + database.test.ts (6 integration, 15s)
8. ✅ **Moved DBWriteQueue.edgecases.test.ts** (Issue #U5) - To integration/ with UUID helper utilities
9. ✅ **Created test-helpers.ts** - Shared UUID utilities using `uuidv4()` directly, following programming fundamentals
10. ✅ **Fixed DBWriteQueue.transactions.test.ts** (Issue #U5) - Rewrote as true integration tests, all 6 tests passing (54s → 16s, 70% faster)
11. ✅ **Moved DBWriteQueue.performance.test.ts** (Issue #U5) - Moved to tests/performance/ with UUID updates, excluded from CI/CD
12. ✅ **Completed Issue #U5** - All test files properly categorized (287s → 46s, 6x faster test suite)
13. ✅ **Unit Test Audit Complete** (2025-10-26) - Comprehensive audit of all 13 unit test files
    - Fixed DBWriteQueue.api.test.ts - Added UUID support, force close (6/6 passing)
    - Fixed DatabaseConfig.test.ts - NaN handling, pool lifecycle (16/18 passing)
    - Fixed MigrationRunner.test.ts - Mock pollution (13/13 passing)
    - Created comprehensive audit report: [UNIT_TEST_AUDIT_FINAL.md](../../UNIT_TEST_AUDIT_FINAL.md)
    - **Final Result: 253/255 tests passing (99.2%)**
    - Zero lingering processes after test execution

### Immediate Next Steps
1. 🟡 Fix Issue #U4 - Update Redis eviction policy to "noeviction" - **30 minutes** (MEDIUM)
2. 🟢 Fix Issue #U6 - Mock 2 DatabaseConfig tests - **30 minutes** (LOW, non-blocking)
3. 🟢 Analyze remaining API integration test failures (separate work) - **Future**
   - Timing/race conditions (8-10 tests)
   - Concurrency edge cases (5-7 tests)
   - Product code bugs (5-7 tests)

## Quick Reference

### Test Organization
```
tests/
├── unit/              # Fast (<100ms), isolated, mocked dependencies
├── integration/       # Infrastructure tests (<10s), real Redis/PostgreSQL
├── e2e/              # Full workflows (<30s), Playwright
├── performance/      # Benchmarks (minutes), intentionally slow
└── load/             # k6 load tests
```

### Performance Targets
- Unit tests: <100ms per test (ideally <20ms)
- Integration tests: <10s per test
- E2E tests: <30s per test
- Total unit suite: <5s
